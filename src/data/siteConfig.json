    "bio": "Hi, I'm Jim Fitzpatrick, but you might know me better as DJ Fitz. Music has been my passion for as long as I can remember - it's the rhythm that's been driving me throughout my life. I've had the privilege of playinh with various bands up and down the East Coast, soaking in the energy of live performances and connecting with people through the universal language of music. Over time, I realized that my true calling wasn't just in playing music, but in creating experiences - curating those perfect musical moments that resonate with people of all ages. ",
